# Testing Guidelines

## Testing Philosophy
- Write tests that enhance code reliability and maintainability
- Focus on behavior rather than implementation details
- Maintain a healthy balance between test coverage and development speed

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components and functions in isolation
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Focus on edge cases and error handling

### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between components
- Verify data flow through multiple layers
- Test API integrations

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify critical business paths
- Include mobile and desktop viewports

## Best Practices
- Write descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Keep tests focused and atomic
- Avoid test interdependence
- Use appropriate testing utilities and helpers

## Test Coverage
- Maintain high coverage of critical paths
- Focus on business logic coverage
- Regular coverage reporting and monitoring

## Testing Tools
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

## Continuous Integration
- Run tests on every pull request
- Maintain fast test execution
- Address test failures promptly
