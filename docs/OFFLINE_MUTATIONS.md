# Offline Mutations Strategy

## Overview

Offline mutations allow users to perform actions while offline, with the changes being synced to the backend once the app regains connectivity. This ensures a seamless user experience even in low or no connectivity scenarios.

## Key Features

1. **Queueing Mutations**:

   - User actions are queued locally when offline.
   - Each mutation includes metadata such as timestamp and action type.

2. **Conflict Resolution**:

   - Implement strategies to handle conflicts when syncing queued mutations with the backend.
   - Use Firestore's server timestamps to determine the latest update.

3. **Retry Mechanism**:

   - Automatically retry failed mutations when connectivity is restored.
   - Use exponential backoff for retries to avoid overwhelming the backend.

4. **User Feedback**:
   - Provide visual indicators for offline status and pending actions.
   - Notify users of any conflicts or errors during sync.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Detect Offline Status**:

   - Use browser APIs (e.g., `navigator.onLine`) to detect connectivity status.
   - Maintain an app-wide state for online/offline status.

2. **Queue Mutations**:

   - Store user actions in a local queue (e.g., IndexedDB or local storage).
   - Ensure the queue persists across app sessions.

3. **Sync Mutations**:

   - Monitor connectivity status and trigger sync when online.
   - Process the queue sequentially to maintain action order.

4. **Conflict Resolution**:

   - Compare local changes with Firestore data during sync.
   - Apply the latest change based on timestamps or user-defined rules.

5. **Error Handling**:

   - Log errors for debugging and analytics.
   - Provide clear feedback to users for unresolved conflicts.

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Batch queued mutations to reduce Firestore write costs.
   - Use efficient data structures for the mutation queue.

## Example Workflow

1. User renames a song while offline.
2. The action is added to the local mutation queue.
3. The UI reflects the change immediately (optimistic update).
4. When the app goes online, the queued action is sent to Firestore.
5. Firestore confirms the update, and the UI is synced with the latest data.
