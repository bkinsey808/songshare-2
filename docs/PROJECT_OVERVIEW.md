# Project Overview

SongShare-2 is a complete rewrite of the original SongShare application. The primary goal of this project is to provide an enhanced platform for "song leaders" to share song information in real time with "community members." This rewrite leverages modern web technologies and a TypeScript-based architecture to improve performance, scalability, and user experience.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Song Sharing**: Song leaders can share playlists, current songs, lyrics, translations, and original languages (e.g., Sanskrit) with community members in real time.
- **Playlist and Song Management**: Song leaders can easily switch between playlists and songs, with updates instantly reflected for followers.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved UI/UX for both song leaders and community members.
- **Modern Technology Stack**: Built entirely in TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

## Technology Stack Goals

To ensure SongShare-2 is deployable across web, iOS, and Android platforms with a single codebase, we will use the following technologies:

- **Expo.dev**: A framework for building cross-platform applications with React Native, enabling deployment to the web, Play Store, and App Store.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and maintainability across the entire codebase.
- **React Native**: To build a shared codebase for mobile platforms (iOS and Android).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For consistent and efficient styling across platforms.
- **Tamagui**: A universal UI kit for React Native and Web, compatible with Expo.
- **Firebase**: For backend services, including authentication, real-time database, and cloud functions.

This stack ensures a seamless development experience and efficient deployment to all target platforms.

## Expanded Details

### User Personas

1. **Song Leaders**:

   - Role: Create and manage playlists, share songs, and interact with community members.
   - Needs: Intuitive tools for managing songs and playlists, real-time updates, and a seamless user interface.

2. **Community Members**:
   - Role: Follow song leaders, view shared songs, and participate in real-time sessions.
   - Needs: Easy access to song information, translations, and lyrics.

### System Architecture

The system is designed with a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. Below is a high-level overview:

- **Frontend**: Built with React Native and Expo for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Backend**: Firebase services for authentication, real-time database, and cloud functions.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS and NativeWind for consistent and efficient UI design.

```

This diagram illustrates the interaction between the key entities in the SongShare-2 system:

1. **Song Leader**:

   - Shares playlists and manages songs by interacting with the backend.
   - Updates made by the song leader are sent to the backend in real time.

2. **Backend (Firebase)**:

   - Acts as the central hub for data storage and processing.
   - Handles real-time updates, authentication, and other backend services.
   - Pushes updates from the song leader to community members.

3. **Community Members**:
   - Follow song leaders and view the shared playlists and songs.
   - Receive real-time updates from the backend to stay synchronized with the latest changes.

The workflow ensures a seamless, real-time interaction where song leaders can manage content dynamically, and community members can consume it instantly.

### Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide song leaders with insights into community engagement.
- **Custom Themes**: Enable users to personalize their interface.
