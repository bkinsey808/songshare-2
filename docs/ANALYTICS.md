# Google Analytics and Tag Manager

## Overview

SongShare-2 integrates Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager (GTM) to track user interactions and gather insights about app usage. These tools help monitor user engagement and optimize the app's performance.

## Key Features

1. **Google Analytics**:

   - Track page views, user sessions, and events.
   - Monitor user engagement with features like event creation, song sharing, and playlist management.
   - Analyze traffic sources to understand how users discover the app.

2. **Google Tag Manager**:
   - Manage and deploy tracking tags without modifying the app's codebase.
   - Track navigation events and other user interactions.

## Integration Steps

### Google Analytics

1. **Set Up Google Analytics**:

   - Create a Google Analytics account and set up a property for SongShare-2.
   - Obtain the tracking ID (e.g., `G-XXXXXXXXXX`).

2. **Install Google Analytics Library**:

   - Use a library like `expo-analytics` or `expo-firebase-analytics` for integration.
   - For web, ensure the `gtag.js` script is included in the `index.html` file.

3. **Add Tracking Code**:

   - Include the Google Analytics tracking code in the app's entry file (e.g., `App.js` or `App.tsx`).
   - For web, initialize Google Analytics using `gtag.js`.

4. **Track Custom Events**:

   - Implement custom event tracking for key user actions, such as:
     - Event creation
     - Song sharing
     - Playlist management
   - Use descriptive event names and include relevant parameters (e.g., `category`, `action`, `label`, `value`).

5. **Test the Integration**:
   - Use Google Analytics Debugger or the real-time analytics dashboard to verify tracking.
   - For mobile, use tools like `adb logcat` (Android) or Xcode logs (iOS) to debug analytics events.

6. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Use batch event logging to reduce network requests.
   - Avoid logging sensitive user data.

### Google Tag Manager

1. **Set Up Google Tag Manager**:

   - Create a Google Tag Manager account and set up a container for SongShare-2.
   - Obtain the GTM container ID (e.g., `GTM-XXXXXXX`).

2. **Install GTM Snippet**:

   - Add the GTM container snippet to the app's entry file to initialize tracking.
   - For web, include the GTM script in the `index.html` file's `<head>` section.

3. **Track Navigation Events**:

   - Use GTM to listen for route changes and log navigation events.
   - Implement custom events for key user actions.
   - For mobile, use GTM's Firebase integration to track events.

4. **Test the Integration**:
   - Use GTM's Preview Mode to verify that navigation events are being tracked correctly.
   - For mobile, use Firebase DebugView to validate GTM events.

5. **Version Control**:
   - Publish GTM container changes only after thorough testing.
   - Use descriptive version names for better tracking of updates.

## Privacy Compliance

- Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations by:
  - Providing users with options to opt out of tracking.
  - Anonymizing user data where possible.
  - Displaying a cookie consent banner for web users.
  - Implementing a consent management platform (CMP) to handle user preferences.

## Best Practices

1. **Data Accuracy**:
   - Use filters in Google Analytics to exclude internal traffic.
   - Regularly audit analytics data for anomalies.

2. **Event Naming Conventions**:
   - Use consistent and descriptive names for events.
   - Avoid overly generic names like `click` or `view`.

3. **Cross-Platform Tracking**:
   - Enable cross-platform tracking to unify user data across web, iOS, and Android.
   - Use the same user ID across platforms for better insights.

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Use Google Analytics to track app performance metrics like load time and errors.
   - Set up alerts for critical issues.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain detailed documentation of all tracked events and GTM configurations.
   - Share documentation with the team to ensure consistency.
