			<p>
				<IconBrand /> helps musicians share songs with their communities. Song
				leaders can share information about the music they are playing in real
				time with people following along on the app, including lyrics,
				translations, credits, and more. Followers receive song changes in real
				time on their own apps, during a live set and thus can gain a deeper
				appreciation of the music.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, community members can build up a song library of their own
				which they can reference after the set is over and even when they are
				offline. And followers can use the app to become song leaders of their
				own if they so choose.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, this app helps a musician log their practice and search
				and organize their song library into playlists. Playlists categorize the
				songs and also track an ordering if that matters. Playlists can be
				shared with the community or kept private for organizational purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this way, <IconBrand /> serves the needs of musicians and their
				communities. It vastly simplifies the process of helping the community
				learn lyrics to songs. It saves trees because printed handouts of lyrics
				are no longer needed. And most everybody carries around a smart phone
				nowadays.
			</p>
			<p>
				<IconBrand /> could be used not just for sharing songs with a community,
				but also prayers, meditations, and many other things. It is intended to
				serve the needs of all faiths and spiritual traditions.
